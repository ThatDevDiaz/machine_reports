Found http://tickets.keeper.htb/m/
but it seems to be a mobile version

RT/4.4.4+dfsg-2ubuntu1 is the RT version

Directory enumeration finds:
/rt
/rte
/rtl
/rtf
and different file types for each path. none of these are accessible. rt/admin redirects back to login but it exists.

Wappalyzer did not find any results for this webpage

The RT releases shows that one of the versions close to 4.4.4 is vulnerable to timing side-channel attacks. Because

Before using hydra, I tried some super basic default credentials, and with success:
root:password
These credentials worked for for the web app but not for SSH

Found a ticket with the user:
Inorgaard (Lisa Norgaard) : lnorgaard@keeper.htb
Found user creation history that shows their initial password was set to Welcome2023! 

Configuration revealed database information:
port: 3306
databaseName 'rtdb'
databaseUser 'rtuser'
databaseAdmin 'postgres'

Perl 5.34 and Apache 2.4.52 discovered

Tried adding a script but there is a CSRF protection in place that did not allow it. redirection
url brings a 404 error. Maybe a session cookie exploit would work? 

I try accessing the routes manually, but they all throw a 404 error. Not sure these functions even work.
Seems like all creation/deletion actions throw this CSRF error.

I've been trying to use ffuf to figure out if the next parameter is exploitable with LFI using the admin
session cookie, but only got a single result:
