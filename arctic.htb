10.129.132.220:8500 in the browser reveals a directory. After navigating a bit I discovered the usage of CF Adobe coldfusion 8.
Some research tells me that /CFIDE/Administrator is a common path, and when tested the login page was revealed. 
  Admin credential is already auto-populated. Going to try default credentials.


Found a metasploit module to scan coldfusion:
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/http/coldfusion_locale_traversal) > run

and a few others but they just redirected me to the login page html.

This metasploit module didn't work either. Trying to enumerate further.
After continously trying to automate file uploads using metasploit, they weren't working. I tried a manual file upload:
┌──(cesar㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ curl -F "NewFile=@shell.cfm" "http://10.129.132.220:8500/CFIDE/scripts/ajax/FCKeditor/editor/filemanager/connectors/cfm/upload.cfm"

the upload succeeded. Could not locate the uploaded file. Moved onto another vulnerability.

After reading a github repository on CVE-2010-2861, I ran this command with the help of chatgpt:
curl -s "http://10.129.132.220:8500/CFIDE/administrator/enter.cfm?locale=../../../../../../../lib/password.properties%00en"
and I was able to find passwords.

rdspassword=0IA/F[[E>[$_6& \\Q>[K\=XP  \n
password=2F635F6D20E3FDE0C53075A84B68FB07DCEC9B03
encrypted=true

First step was to break down the hash. It's an RDS hash. ran:
echo "2F635F6D20E3FDE0C53075A84B68FB07DCEC9B03" | hashid
returned SHA-1. Time to crack
Dictionary cache hit:

Login to admin panel with this password was a success.
I was able to get a successful remote shell by going into the scheduled tasks section and creating a task.
First, I created a shell.cfm file because its what coldfusion has permission to execute.

I then created a powershell file that would create a reverse shell on port 4444 to my machine.
The shell.cfm file would execute upon triggering, and it would open and auto-execute the powershell script.
I uploaded both files to the scheduled tasks successfully and when executing shell.cfm from the browser and the NC -lvnp 4444 listener on, 
it created the successful remote shell.

After navigating around, I found the user "tolis" who had a flag user.txt on their desktop. User flag submitted. 

current shell is arctic\tolis
systeminfo confirms:
Windows 2008 server R2 6.1.76
running on VMWare

I went back and created the same reverse shell, but I setup metasploit as the listener so I can use metasploit on the shell.

I backgrounded the session and used post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester Metasploit module to scan for exploits but nothing came up.

After a very long frustrating session of trying to find ways to upload reverse shells that execute as system and running metasploit modules with
no success, I decided to lookup some assistance (without looking up the full answer).

I came across the tool "Chimichurri" which is used exactly for the very vulnerability this user is exposed to.

Using chatgpt to learn how Chimichurri works and how to set it up, I was able to successful launch the reverse shell by sending the chimichurri exe
to the target, then executing it with the already logged in user. This escalated me to system

Root flag found. Machine owned.3
